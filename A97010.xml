         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Upon pretence of which Order the ſaid <hi>Humphrey Edwards,</hi> upon Thurſday the 21 of <hi>March,</hi> 1649. riotouſly, reproachfully and wickedly, without reſpect to the Laws of God, which forbiddeth to covet his neighbors Goods, the Laws of the Land, the Honor of the Parliament, and contrary to a good Conſcience, forcibly entered into my houſe, and thence (after many threats and reproachful names (fit only to be uſed by Brothellers, and not perſons profeſſing themſelves to be Chriſtian Magiſtrates) expelled my ancient ſervant, taking and keeping poſſeſſion of the ſame, as if he conceived that the ſingle Order of the Committee of the Revenue would both in the Judgment of Parliament, and Eye of the Law, not only be equivolent to, but ſufficient to deſtroy mine and my husbands ancient Right and Title to the Premiſes.</p>
            <p>But maugre all his malice and cruelty; it ſhall never enter into my heart to beleeve, (notwithſtanding by reaſon of ſome miſapprehenſions my husband be a priſoner under diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure) That the Parliament can ſo far either forget my husbands faithful Services, large Contributions, and great loſſes, ſuſtained by his acting with, and adhering to them, much leſs their own many frequent ſolemn Declarations, as to ſuffer him to be deſtroyed, either in his life, liberty, or eſtate, without, or contrary to Law, before he be convicted. For it is notoriouſly known, and ready to be proved,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That he hath not only adhered to the Parliament from the beginning, but layd out upon publique Service about three thouſand pounds.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That he ſtands bound at this time for about five thouſand pounds, taken up at <hi>Bristol</hi> for the Parliaments Service with Colonel <hi>Alexander Popham,</hi> for which he is dayly threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened to be ſued.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That he hath loſt above ten thouſand pounds of his eſtate by the Enemy, but never had any reparation, or beneficial employment conferred on him in liew thereof.</p>
            <p>Now, if after all my ſaid husbands ſervice and ſufferings for the Parliament, together with the hard meaſure by him ſuſtained, by reaſon of about twenty weeks impriſonment, upon a ſuggeſtion or ſuppoſition of a miſdemeanor, although nothing material in Law can be proved againſt him, his eſtate alſo of inheritance, and my joynture ſhall be taken away by Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of a Committee upon the ſuit and requeſt of Mr <hi>Edwards,</hi> (who, for ought I know, is a Conſpirator againſt his life or liberty, and ſuggeſteth matters againſt him, thereby to colour his wicked covetous proceedings. in getting and enjoying the ſaid Office,) the Parliament ſhall not pleaſe upon this my Appeal to redreſs this crying grievance, ſuffering their own Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and the Subjects Propriety to be deſtroyed by Mr <hi>Humprey Edwards,</hi> (a perſon who attended the King unto the Houſe, when he demanded the five Members,) contrary to all the known Laws of the Land, and their ſeveral Ordinances, Declarations, Remonſtrances, and Acts, wherein they have ſolemnly engaged to preſerve the ſame. I ſay (if notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this) the Parliament ſhall permit mine and my husbands deſtruction in this way, let God and men judg whether the Laws of the Kingdom, or their many Promiſes, hold forth any ſecurity, but on the contrary diſcover the ſlavery that we are in, and are like to undergo through the exerciſe and exaltation of lawleſs will and pleaſure, and neglect of the execution of thoſe precious Conſervators of the Lives, Liberties and Properties of the good People of this Nation, the eſtabliſhed Laws, &amp;c. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By the 29 Chapter of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> it is provided, That no man ſhall be diſſeized of his Free-hold, or Free-cuſtoms, or Birth-right, but by due courſe and proceſs of Law, not upon Petition or Suggeſtion. See Sir <hi>Edward Cooks</hi> Expoſition of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> fol. 46. publiſhed for good Law by this preſent Parliament. So alſo the ſame <hi>Edw. Cook</hi> in his third part <hi>Inſtitutes,</hi> Chap. 114. fol. 228. declares, That regularly the Goods of a Delinquent cannot be taken and ſeized before forfeiture; and in the ſame Chapter he draws theſe two principal Concluſions:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That before Indictment, the Goods, or other things, of any offender, cannot be ſearched, inventoried, or in any ſort ſeized; nor after Indictment ſeized and removed, or taken away before conviction and retainder.</item>
               <item>2. That the begging of the Goods or Eſtate of any Delinquent, accuſed or indicted of any Treaſon, Felony, or other offence, before he be convicted and attainted, is utterly unlawful: And he giveth theſe Reaſons:
<list>
                     <item>1. Becauſe it maketh the proſecution againſt the Delinquent more precipitate, violent, and undue, then the quiet and equal proceeding of Law and Juſtice would permit. Or,</item>
                     <item>2. It occaſioneth ſome under-hand Compoſition or Agreement thereby to ſtop and hinder the due courſe of Juſtice for the exemplary puniſhment of the offender.</item>
                     <item>3. It diſcourageth both Judg, Juror and Witneſs to do their duty.</item>
                  </list>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>And as it is contrary to Law, ſo it is derogatory unto the Honor of Parliament, all their Ordinances, Declarations, Remonſtrances, and Acts, (wherein they have ſolemnly engaged to preſerve unto the People their juſt Rights, in the Preſervation of the eſtabliſhed good old Laws and Cuſtoms of <hi>England,</hi> by themſelves declared to be the Badges of our Freedom, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe excellent Laws <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and <hi>the Petition of Right,</hi> by themſelves ſo called, in their Declaration of <hi>March,</hi> 1648. declaring the Reaſons of their altering the preſent Government, as alſo their Declaration of <hi>Febr.</hi> 9. 1648. wherein they declare, that they <hi>are fully reſolved to maintain, and ſhall and will uphold, preſerve and keep the Fundamental Laws of this Nation, for, and concerning the preſervation of the Lives, Properties and Liberties of the People, with all things incident thereunto:</hi> I ſay, all theſe ſolemn Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by this Act of Mr <hi>Humphrey Edwards,</hi> upon pretence of an Order from the Committee of the Revenue, are rendered but a mockery and deluſion: for if mine and my husbands juſt Right and Propriety to the ſaid Office ſhall thus, by the Authority of the ſaid Committee, be taken from us, (my husband having never yet received any Charge, (although two or three Goal Deliveries have been ſince his impriſonment, by which he ought to have been tryed, acquitted or condemned,) much leſs was ever convicted; or if he had, his Conviction could not forfeit my Intereſt and Right, which I had ſixteen years before his ſuppoſed offence:) I ſay, if this ſhall be owned, or not remedied, and publiquely declared againſt by the Parliament, let God and good men judg, whether the good old Laws and Cuſtoms of the Nation be upheld, or our Lives, Liberties or Eſtates preſerved.</p>
            <p>But (notwithſtanding the hard meaſure I have ſuſtained in all the fore-going Premiſes) it ſhall not enter into my heart to believe, That the Parliament, which hath ſo frequently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared againſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tyranny, and ſo highly advanced Juſtice and Equity, not exempting the greateſt, will either own, or permit ſo great a diſhonor to themſelves, or oppreſſion to me: In the aſſurance whereof I am bold to preſent this my Appeal unto the Parliament, and every Member thereof;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Humbly praying, That the Order of the Committee of the Revenue for authorizing the ſaid</hi> Humphrey Edwards <hi>to officiate in the ſaid Office, may be by the Authority of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment annulled and declared againſt; and that I may be left unto the Law to obtain reparations of the ſaid Mr</hi> Humphrey Edwards, <hi>as well for his Conſpiracy againſt my huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands Life and Liberty, as for his riot and forcibly entery into my ſaid houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <closer>For which I ſhall be engaged to pray, &amp;c.
